# Data_Cleaning

Do you want to learn data cleaning with Pandas? This tutorial will teach you everything you need.

Pandas is a Python library widely used for data analysis and manipulation. However, the data you read from a source often needs a series of data cleaning steps before you can analyze it to gain insights, answer business questions, or build machine learning models. This guide breaks down the data cleaning process with Pandas into 6 practical steps. We will create a sample dataset and go through the data cleaning steps.

# Creating a Sample DataFrame
Before starting the data cleaning steps, we will create a Pandas DataFrame with employee records. We will use the Faker library to generate fake data.

## Step 1: Understanding the Data
Before performing any specific operations on the data, we need to have an overall view of the information, see what each column contains, how many records there are, and so on. Here, we use the info() method to display general information.

## Step 2: Checking for Duplicate Rows
Now we want to focus on removing duplicate rows in the DataFrame. These duplicate rows can cause issues in data analysis because they skew the results. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and remove these rows to work only with unique and non-repeating data. This way, we will have a more accurate analysis.

## Step 3: Handling Missing Data
Missing data is a common issue in data quality in many data science projects. If you look at the output of the info() method from the previous step, you will probably notice that the number of non-null records is not the same for all fields, and there are missing values in the 'Email' column. However, we will determine the exact number of missing values.

## Step 4: Data Conversion
When working with a dataset, it is possible that one or more fields do not have the expected data type in our DataFrame. For example, in this case, the 'Join_Date' field should be converted to a valid date and time.

## Step 5: Cleaning Text Data
When dealing with string (text) fields, we often encounter conflicting formats or similar issues. Cleaning text can range from simply changing letter cases (uppercase to lowercase or vice versa) to writing a complex regular expression to achieve the desired format.

In the DataFrame we have, we see that the 'Address' column contains many newline characters ('\n') which makes it difficult to read. Therefore, let's replace them with spaces.

## Step 6: Cleaning Outliers
Sometimes our data contains very unusual numbers, such as very high salaries that were entered incorrectly. We need to find these and make sure they don't distort the rest of the data. We can identify which data points are significantly different from the others and then either remove them or investigate them separately.
